After that half of a work is done :sunglasses:

## What you will have out of the box

- The following configured CI pipelines:
  - `Security tests` using [Snyk](https://snyk.io) and [CodeQL](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).
  - Twice a month check `npm` updates and create PR automatically in case of any new versions are exist.
  - `Create release` pipeline that will create a new release when you merge your MR into `main` branch.
  - `Unit tests` pipeline that will run `lint` and `test` commands on each push to `main`, `feature/*` or `bugfix/*` branch.
  - `Yaml Lint` pipeline that will lint `yaml` files in case of any of them have been changed.
- `PR`, `Bug report` and `Feature request` GitHub templates.
- `README`, `LICENSE` and `Contributing` documentation files.
- `git` hooks that are:
  - checking that you're **not** committing into `main` branch.
  - checking that you're **not** committing any sensitive information.
  - running `lint` and `test` commands on each `git push`.
  - building `dist/index.js` file (that is used as a main file for GitHub Action) on each `git commit`.
